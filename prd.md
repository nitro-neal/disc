### DiscBagPro ‚Äì Functional PRD (feature-by-feature, tech-agnostic)

This document specifies the complete, user-visible functionality of the DiscBagPro app so it can be reproduced without referencing implementation details or styling. It covers pages, links, inputs, outputs, state changes, and behaviors.

### Scope and goals
- Help users discover discs by brand and by flight characteristics.
- Let users view details for any disc, visualize its flight, and find similar discs.
- Let users create and manage multiple disc bags, add/remove discs, and view a bag report with analysis and a combined flight chart.
- Provide curated professional bags for inspiration and one-click import.

### Global layout and navigation
- **Header**
  - **Logo**: Clicking the app logo navigates to `/` (Home).
  - **Search bar** (global):
    - User types a query to search discs by name, brand, or category.
    - While typing, a dropdown opens showing up to 8 matching discs.
    - Each result shows disc name, brand, flight numbers, and a colored initial.
    - Keyboard support: Up/Down to move selection; Enter opens the selected disc detail; Escape closes the dropdown.
    - Clicking a result navigates to `/disc/:slug` for that disc.
    - Clear (‚úï) button empties the search field and closes the dropdown.
  - **Desktop nav** links: `Brands` ‚Üí `/brand`, `Flight Search` ‚Üí `/flight`, `Get Good` ‚Üí `/get-good`, `Pro Bags` ‚Üí `/pro-bags`, `My Bags` ‚Üí `/bags`.
  - **Mobile**
    - A menu button toggles the mobile nav listing the same links. Selecting a link closes the menu and navigates.
    - A `üéí` shortcut opens `My Bags` (`/bags`).
  - **Theme toggle**: Switching the toggle immediately changes the dark / light theme and persists the choice. The toggle is also present in the mobile menu.
- **Footer**
  - Shows static text and two external links: `About`, `Contact` (placeholders).

### Data and persistence (functional)
- **Disc database**: Automatically loads on app start. If loading fails, show a generic error message on affected pages.
- **Bags**: Stored locally. Creating, updating (name, description, contents), and deleting bags persist across sessions.
- **Settings**: dark / light Theme preference persists across sessions.
